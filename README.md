## U.S. K-12 Education and Mobility

Mobility, defined in terms of the expected income rank of a child, given his/her corresponding percentile of parent income has been found to be unequal across the United States. In a 2014 paper on this topic, Chetty et al use education features, demographic information and IRS data to determine what the trends look like geographically. My visualization explores this relationship with the newest data set - and provides users with a clear picture into the correlations between mobility and educational factors.
